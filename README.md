# HR- Analytics

## Problem Statement
The dataset hr_data.csv contains sample of candidates that we part of a recruitment process of particular client of ScaleneWorks. ScaleneWorks supports several information technology(IT) companies in India with their talent acquisition. One of the challenge they face is about **30% of the candidates who accept the jobs offers, do not join the company.** 
This lead to huge loss of revenue and time as the companies initiate the recruitment process again to fill the workforce demand. ScaleneWorks want to find out if a model can be build to predict the likelihood of a candidate joining the company. If the likelihood is high, then the company can go ahead and offer the jobs to the candidates.

### Criteria
**Cost of predicting “Not Joining” as “Joining” (FPs) cases is 3 times more than predicting “Joining” as “Not Joining” (FNs)**
